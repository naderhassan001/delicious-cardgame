<h1 align="center">Card Flip Game</h1>

<p align="center">
This is a card flip game. It is based on my favorite things, eating! Click on a picture and then another picture. If they add up, the counter increases by one and the card stay revealed. If not, both cards are flipped over. This is just a simple front end project.
